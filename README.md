Arabic Handwriting recognition 

An Optical Character Recognition of Handwritten Arabic Numerals/Digits using
Artificial Neural Networks (Presentation Topic: Artificial Neural Networks)
Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the automated conversion of images of typed,
handwritten, or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a
document, a scene-photo (e.g., the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text
superimposed on an image (e.g., from a television broadcast). Build an OCR using Artificial Neural Networks to
identify Handwritten Arabic Numerals (Arabic Numbers: 0, 1, 2, .. 9).


it was a team task not only me worked on it
